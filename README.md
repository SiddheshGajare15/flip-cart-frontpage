**Flipkart Login Page Layout
This project is a simple implementation of a Flipkart-like login page using HTML and CSS. The page is divided into two main sections: a left-side section with login information and an image, and a right-side section containing the input fields and buttons.

File Structure
index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the page.
style.css: Contains the CSS styling for the page (embedded in the <style> tag within the HTML).
HTML Structure
The main HTML structure is divided into two parts:

Left Section (box1):

Contains a heading (<h2>) and a paragraph (<p>) that describes the benefits of logging in.
An image is placed at the bottom of this section.
Right Section (box2):

Contains an input field for the user to enter their email or mobile number.
Displays a message about agreeing to Flipkart's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
Includes a button to request an OTP (One-Time Password).
Provides a link for users who are new to Flipkart to create an account.
CSS Styling
The layout uses a Flexbox model to create a responsive design.
The left section (box1) has a blue background and displays content and an image.
The right section (box2) has a light gray background and contains the form elements.
The input fields have custom borders and padding, and the button is styled with a red background and white text.
The link to create an account is centered at the bottom of the right section.
How to Use
Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the page.
The page is styled to resemble a Flipkart login screen, with a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
Customization
Image: Replace the ssflip.jpg image with any other image to customize the look of the left section.
Colors: Modify the color values in the CSS to match your branding or preference.
Text: Update the text content within the HTML to reflect the correct information for your project.
